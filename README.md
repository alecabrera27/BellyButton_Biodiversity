# BellyButton_Biodiversity

## Overview

A company has sample the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each personâ€™s identity is anonymous, they have been assigned an ID number. We have been asked  to build a dashboard that both her research participants, and fellow researchers can access.Those who participated in the study will be able to visit a web site and select their ID number to see which bacterial species live in their navels.
Included on our web site there will be a visualization of the results, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.
